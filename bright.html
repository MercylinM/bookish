            <p>"Color": This directly illustrate the main theme of the race and identity that pervade through out the
                book. Noar's experiences are often brutal racial classifications of apartheid South Africa. His very
                Exstence as a mixed-race child defined so much of his early life.<br>"Laughter": Despite the serious and
                difficult subject matter, humor is a constant thread throughout the book </p>

                <h2>Born a Crime - Individual Reflection</h2>
                <p>By Bright Karanja</p>

                    Think about it, Abel was drawn to women with their spirit and independence. He didn't want someone
                    meek or submissive. Yet, his ultimate desire was to confine them within the rigid structure of a
                    "traditional marriage," effectively clipping their wings. This isn't just a reflection of
                    apartheid-era South Africa; it echoes in present-day relationships too.

                We often see individuals who were initially attracted to a partner's strength and ambition, only to
                later feel threatened by it. This can manifest in precise ways, discouragement of career goals,
                expectations of primary responsibility for domestic duties, or even emotional manipulation that
                slowly erodes a partner's self-governance. The "cage" isn't always bars; it can be built with
                expectations and control.

                Abel's contradiction reveals a deep-seated patriarchal mindset. He appreciates the idea of a free
                woman, perhaps even enjoys the initial challenge and vibrancy she brings. But ultimately, he seeks
                the comfort and control of a traditional power dynamic. This resonates today when we see individuals
                who pay lip service to equality but struggle with truly equitable partnerships. They might admire a
                partner's success externally but resent the shift in traditional roles within the home.
                </p>

                Noah's insight is a powerful reminder to examine our own expectations and desires in relationships.
                Are we truly celebrating our partners' freedom, or do we conceal a suppressed desire to contain it?
                Recognizing this potential "cage of admiration" is the first step towards building truly equal and
                liberating partnerships.
