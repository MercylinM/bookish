                        <p>Trevor describes feeling like an outsider, as if he was "all by myself"<br>
                            even while being surrounded by others. He felt the need to be anonymous <br>
                            and invisible rather than seeking acceptance for his whole self.<br>
                            Trevor Noah frequently describes feeling invisible at school, <br>
                            particularly ,at Sandringham,a high-school with students of all<br>
                            races and backgrounds.Trevor found it difficult to find a "niche". <br>
                            He felt like he wasn't quite part of the black community or the white <br>
                            community, leading to a sense of isolation and invisibility.</p>

                        <p>people in his school were grouped by color in most cases.<br>
                            even with so many different groups to choose from,he was not a .<br>
                            natural constituent of any particular one .The colored kids would shit .<br>
                            on Trevor all the time for being too black .even if he was skilled with the<br>
                            white kids not to get bullied by them , they were always going shooping and movies<br>
                            and he didnt have money so he was out of the mix there,too. He learned to navigate <br>
                            these spaces by becoming a "chameleon,"he learned how to blend,he learned that even though
                            he didnot.<br>
                            belong to one group he could be a part of any group,but this constant performance also.<br>
                            contributed to his feeling of being unseen.<br><br>

                <h1>Personal Exprience</h1>
                <p>The same with Trevor history,i was a person who said "all by myself ".when i went to highschool i was
                    like an outsider who<br>
                    observe others when they play,eat,going home and study together .At that time i was a new comer<br>
                    to that school and also to the society,it was hard for me to adapt their accent and their
                    lifestyle.<br>
                    This made me to be an introvert,invisible and shy.people in my school were also grouped based on
                    their<br>
                    place where they live and based on their wealth level but i was neither of these groups even if i
                    want to <br>
                    conform the atmosphere.As a student i was broke when student went to shopping,cinema and trip i did
                    my <br>
                    assignments or study my lessons.For me ,i was a clever student and everyone use to ask me to do
                    their home work<br>
                    or assignment and that was the only chance to communicate with them ,if i want to ask a favour or
                    anything from them <br>
                    i use to do their tasks.</p>

                <h2>Patricia as a Protagonist</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text">

                <p>Patricia, a woman of color in Apartheid South Africa, lived under a system that limited
                    opportunities and freedoms for black South Africans. Despite these limitations, she demonstrated
                    a deep-seated ability to think for herself and to question authority, creating a space for
                    independent thought that influenced her son and his future.<br><br>

                    The reason that Patricia’s push for independent thought powerful is:<br>
                    Challenging Apartheid:
                    Patricia's life was a direct challenge to the <br>
                    discriminatory laws of Apartheid. She defied these laws by raising <br>
                    a biracial child and refusing to conform to the limitations imposed on black
                    women.<br><br>
                    Empowering a Generation:
                    Her independent thinking provided a foundation for Trevor Noah's journey, allowing him to
                    navigate a society that demanded conformity and to ultimately pursue a career where he could
                    express his own unique perspective.<br><br>
                    Refusal to Conform:
                    Patricia refused to be defined by societal expectations, especially those imposed upon black
                    women. She chose her own path, demonstrating the power of independent thought to overcome
                    adversity.
                    Inspiring Future Generation:<br><br>
                    Her story inspires readers to question the status quo, think critically, and to embrace their
                    individuality, particularly in the face of adversity and systemic oppression.

                        <p>During apartheid, simply being Trevor's mother – a Black woman with a mixed-race child – put
                            both
                            of them in constant danger. </p>
                        <p>Patricia navigated this by:</p>
                        <h3>1. Constantly strategizing and making difficult choices</h3>
                        <p>- She moved to different neighborhoods, sometimes illegally, and even pretended Trevor
                            belonged
                            to someone else to keep him safe from authorities.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>2. Teaching him survival skills</h3>
                        <p>- She taught him multiple languages so he could blend into different communities and avoid
                            detection. She also instilled in him a sense of independence and the ability to think on his
                            feet.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>3. Providing unwavering love and support</h3>
                        <p>- Despite the harsh realities they faced, Patricia's fierce passion and determination created
                            a
                            sense of security for Trevor in a world that was inherently hostile to his existence. Her
                            discipline, though sometimes strict, came from wanting to equip him for a difficult life.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This reflects the idea of family as a shield because Patricia actively worked to buffer
                            Trevor
                            from the dangers and injustices of the apartheid regime. She used her ingenuity, resilience,
                            and
                            love to create a layer of protection around him, much like a shield deflects attacks.</p>

                        <h1>Real-life examples</h1>
                        <h3>* Families protecting children from bullying </h3>
                        <p>Parents might intervene with the school, teach their child assertive communication skills, or
                            offer emotional support to help them cope.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>* Families supporting members facing discrimination</h3>
                        <p> When an individual experiences racism, sexism, or other forms of prejudice, their family can
                            provide a safe space, offer encouragement, and even advocate on their behalf.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>* Families helping each other through financial hardship</h3>
                        <p>During job loss or economic downturns, family members often pool resources, offer shelter, or
                            provide emotional support to help each other survive.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>* Families caring for vulnerable members</h3>
                        <p>Whether it's an elderly parent, a child with special needs, or a family member struggling
                            with illness, the family unit often acts as the primary source of care and protection.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <p>In essence, family as a shield means that the bonds and support within a family unit serve to
                            safeguard its members from external threats, whether they are physical, emotional, social,
                            or economic. Patricia's actions in Born a Crime are a powerful and poignant example of this
                            concept in the face of extreme adversity.</p>

                        walked in and asked for it.Trevor uses his wit <br>and ability to use humor to address serious
                        issues like hypocrisy and <br>inequality within institutions.It also reflects his critical
                        thinking and <br>willingness to challenge authority even as a child.</p> <br>

                        moving taxi.Instead of focusing on the <br> danger,Trevor uses humor to describe the absurdity

                        colonial influence.One memorable example is when he <br>humorously notes that his family
                        believed that God paid more attention <br>to prayers in English.This belief is deeply rooted in
                        the colonial legacy of <br> English as a dominant language,reflects how colonial influence
                        shaped <br> their their spiritual practices.He also describes how sundays were purely <br>
                        dedicated to going to church and how grueling the experience was to <br> him.However, due to his
                        mother's unwavering faith and belief in power <br>of prayer he was constantly reminded that he
                        needed to pray and go <br>to church.

                        his own naivety.This shows <br>how Trevor uses humor to process and rise above difficult

            <div class="menu-category">
               <p>Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted into Black culture.
                Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga, English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups  at school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
