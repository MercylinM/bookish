            <h1>Unbelonging</h1>
            <p> <em>Unbelonging </em>captures the essence of Trevor Noah’s<br>
                experience growing up mixed-race in apartheid and post-apartheid<br> South Africa.
                Under appartied noah's existence as a mixed race child was <br>totally illegal and
                made him to felt unbelonginess.He was like an outsider <br>in school,social life(too black
                to be accepted by white south african,too white to <br>be accepted by black african and
                not quit fitting the coloured identity either)<br>,even the ability to speak
                multilanguage made him to be an outsider ,<br>always adapting but never fully rooted.

                <h2>Born a Crime – Individual Reflection</h2>
                <p>By Lwam Bisrat</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-info">
                <blockquote>
                    " Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                    subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."
                </blockquote>

                <p> This quote irritated me when it comes to gender roles. Abel, in theory, desires a woman who conforms
                    to traditional</p>
                <p> expectations, someone subservient and obedient. However, his heart betrays him; he's drawn to women
                    with independent </p>
                <p> spirits, women who refuse to be confined. The tragic irony is that Abel, driven by his own
                    insecurities or desire for</p>
                <p>control, ultimately seeks to "cage" the very freedom he admires. </p>
                <p> Many men claim to want an "independent " woman-educated,ambitions,outspoken but still expect her to
                    shrink herself in </p>
                <p> private.for example a boyfriend praises his girlfriends career success but sulks when she works late
                    but tradition</p>
                <p>doesn't mean oppression.Like patricia,breaking free from these cages isn't just rebellion;it's
                    survival. </p>
                <p> This quote can resonate with girls and women for several reasons:</p>

                <p> -Recognition of a Familiar Pattern: Many women have encountered men, or know of men, who express a
                    desire for a "traditional" partner while simultaneously being drawn to women who are independent and
                    strong. </p>
                <p> - Fear of Being "Caged": The phrase "put her in a cage" evokes a strong emotional response. It
                    speaks to the fear of losing one's autonomy, freedom, and sense of self within a relationship. Women
                    who value their independence might find this prospect particularly alarming, as it represents a
                    potential loss of control over their own lives.</p>
                <p> -Warning Sign Recognition: The quote can serve as a warning sign, alerting women to be wary of
                    partners who express a desire for a "traditional" wife while exhibiting controlling tendencies. It
                    encourages women to be vigilant and protect their independence within relationships</p>
                <p> -Awareness of Double Standards: The quote exposes a double standard: the expectation that women
                    should be both independent and subservient. It highlights the pressure women face to conform to
                    conflicting ideals, often leading to a sense of being "damned if you do, damned if you don't.</p>
