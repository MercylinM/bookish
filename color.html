            <h1>The Color of Laughter</h1>
            <p><em>The Color of Laughter:</em> Aims to capture both the significant role of race in Noah's narrative and the
                surprising and effective use of humor as a tool for survival and understanding. It suggests a story where
                serious issues are explored with intelligence and a disarming sense of humor. </p>

                <h2>Born a Crime - Individual Reflection</h2>
                <p>By Bright Karanja</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-info">
                <blockquote>
                    "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                    subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
                </blockquote>


                <p>
                    Think about it, Abel was drawn to women with their spirit and independence. He didn't want someone
                    meek or submissive. Yet, his ultimate desire was to confine them within the rigid structure of a
                    "traditional marriage," effectively clipping their wings. This isn't just a reflection of
                    apartheid-era South Africa; it echoes in present-day relationships too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We often see individuals who were initially attracted to a partner's strength and ambition, only to
                    later feel threatened by it. This can manifest in precise ways, discouragement of career goals,
                    expectations of primary responsibility for domestic duties, or even emotional manipulation that
                    slowly erodes a partner's self-governance. The "cage" isn't always bars; it can be built with
                    expectations and control.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Abel's contradiction reveals a deep-seated patriarchal mindset. He appreciates the idea of a free
                    woman, perhaps even enjoys the initial challenge and vibrancy she brings. But ultimately, he seeks
                    the comfort and control of a traditional power dynamic. This resonates today when we see individuals
                    who pay lip service to equality but struggle with truly equitable partnerships. They might admire a
                    partner's success externally but resent the shift in traditional roles within the home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Noah's insight is a powerful reminder to examine our own expectations and desires in relationships.
                    Are we truly celebrating our partners' freedom, or do we conceal a suppressed desire to contain it?
                    Recognizing this potential "cage of admiration" is the first step towards building truly equal and
                    liberating partnerships.
