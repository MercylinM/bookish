# Bookish Website

The website serves as a collection of **Personal Reflections** where members share their thoughts, growth moments and personal takeaways from books, and **Book Reviews**, honest reviews based on our reading experiences.

**Bookish** is a cozy online space for our book club, where we explore self-help and personal growth through reading.

We focus on thought-provoking books that inspire personal reflections, engagements and positive change.

## About the Club

- *Born a Crime* by Trevoh Noah
