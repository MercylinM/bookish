            <h1>Living Between World</h1>
            
            <p><em>Living Between World's</em>Trevour's story is not just about aparthied; 
                it's about finding strength in spaces where you
                don't fully belong, which is something i believe
                many women-especially  in transitioning socities -can
                deeply relate to. This title is powerful because it 
                highlights how identity, belonging, and resilience 
                can exist even in the most divided worlds.

                    <blockquote>
                "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife,
                    but he never fell in love with subservient women... he only
                    wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her 
                    in a cage" 
                </blockquote>

                  <p>It really struck me because it perfectly captures 
                    the tension that exists in many relationships, not just in 
                    the context of apartheid but in today’s world as well. 
                    It made me think about how some men, even while valuing a 
                    woman’s independence, still want to control her in some way,
                    limiting her freedom under the guise of love or tradition.</p>

                    <p>
                    When I read this, I couldn't help but think about how it
                    resonates with the contradictions in gender roles today. 
                    On one hand, we live in a world that increasingly supports 
                     women's independence. Women are going after their careers, 
                     speaking out, and gaining more power in relationships. 
                     But then, on the other hand, there are still many expectations
                    placed on women to behave in certain ways, especially in relationships.
                     We’re expected to be strong and independent, but the moment we challenge 
                     traditional roles or assert our freedom, it seems like there's always an 
                     underlying expectation for us to "return to our place."
                     </p>
                     <p>
                    In my view, this is a dynamic I see in many relationships today, 
                    including those in my community. For example, women can achieve 
                    so much in their careers, but there is still pressure to maintain 
                    traditional roles at home. Many women juggle professional 
                    responsibilities but are expected to be the primary caregivers,
                     to manage the household, and fulfill certain expectations about 
                     what it means to be a “good wife.” This is very much like Abel’s 
                     idea of putting a woman in a “cage.” It's as if society allows us
                    to be "free," but only in ways that don't challenge the dominant power structures.
