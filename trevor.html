                        <p>Trevor describes feeling like an outsider,as if he were "I can do everything by myself,"<br> even while being surrounded by others. He felt the need to be anonymous and invisible <br>rather than seeking acceptance for his whole self. Trevor Noah frequently describes <br> feeling invisible at school, particularly at Sandringham,a high-school with students <br>of all races and backgrounds.Trevor found it difficult to find a "niche". He felt like he <br>wasn't quite part of the black community or the white community, leading to a <br> sense of isolation and invisibility.</p>

                    <div class="student-exprience">
                        <p>People in his school were grouped by color in most cases.Even with so many different <br>groups to choose from, he was not a natural constituent of any particular one. The <br>colored  kids would shit on Trevor all the time for being too black .evenif he was skilled <br> with the white kids not to get bullied by them, they were always going  shopping and  <br>to movies, and he didn't have money, So he was out of the mix there,too. He learned to <br> navigate these spaces by becoming a "chameleon," he learned how to blend, he learned <br> that even though he didn't belong to one group, he could be a part of any group, but this <br>constant performance also contributed to his feeling of being unseen.</p>

                    <h1>Personal Experience</h1>
                    <p>The same with Trevor's history,I was the kind of person who said "I can do everything by myself". <br>When I went to high school I was like an outsider who observed others when they played,eat, <br>went home, and studied together.At that time,was a newcomer to that school and also to the <br> society,it was hard to adapt their accent and their lifestyle. This made me quit, invisible and shy. <br>People in my school were also grouped based on where they lived and their wealth level, but I <br> was neither of these groups even if I want to conform the atmosphere.As a student I was broke <br> when student went to shopping, cinema, and trip I did my assignments or studied my lessons.  <br> For me, I was a clever student and they would ask me to do their homework or assignments <br> and that was the only chance to communicate with them, if I wanted to ask a favour <br>or anything from them I use to do their tasks.</p>
                </div>
                    <div class="fact">
                        <p> Generally, an outsider is that who has the feeling that he or she “is different from other people” and thinks that something is “wrong with he/she,” but this is not the case at all.facing rejection from others and being bullied or excluded can be Incredibly painful to experience. Feeling like an  outsider takes  a toll on mental health, leading to significant issues like low  self-esteem, hopelessness, loneliness, or depression.In contrary their  unique perspectives and fresh perspectives, often free from established group norms can lead to innovative solutions and a broader range of ideas.</p>

                    Patricia Noah’s emphasis on independent thought transcended mere <br>parenting; it was a crucial survival
                    skill under apartheid. She armed <br>Trevor with the ability >to question everything, enabling him to navigate <br>
                    segregation’s absurdities, challenge racial barriers, and build resilience <br> againist oppression. In a society  built on
                    enforced ignorance,  critical <br> thinking became a tool for recognizing injustice,even those that <br> were not 
                    noticeable or were just taken for reality.

                    <p>
                    This foundation proved invaluable. Instead of accepting the world as it was <br>presented,
                    Trevour learned to analyze, discern, and form his own conclusions. <br>This ability to think 
                    critically wasn’t  just about intellectual curiosity; it was about <br> empowerment and 
                    self-determination.She showed that everyone should look <br> outside the box and think 
                    with different eyes in order to be a fully functioning  <br>person.  This early training profoundly shaped Trevour’s career. His observational <br>comedy, empathy and nuanced perspective as host of “The Daily Show “ stem <br> directly from his
                    ability to analyze complex issues and challenge conventional <br> wisdom. He showed that
                    his voice has a big effect on people of all types.

                        <p>Patricia navigated this by:</p>

                        <li>Constantly strategizing and making difficult choices: </em>She moved to different neighborhoods, sometimes illegally, and even pretended Trevor belonged to someone else to keep him safe from authorities.</li>
                    
                        <li> Teaching him survival skills: </em>She taught him multiple languages so he could blend into different communities and avoid
                            detection. She also instilled in him a sense of independence and the ability to think on his
                            feet.</li>

                        <li>Providing unwavering love and support: </em>Despite the harsh realities they faced, Patricia's fierce passion and determination created
                            a sense of security for Trevor in a world that was inherently hostile to his existence. Her discipline, though sometimes strict, came from wanting to equip him for a difficult life.</li>

                            Trevor from the dangers and injustices of the apartheid regime. She used her ingenuity, resilience,
                            and love to create a layer of protection around him, much like a shield deflects attacks.</p>

                        mother's unwavering faith and belief in power of prayer he was constantly reminded that he

                <p>Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen
                    land.  <br>The white South Africans called Afrikaners  descended from these colonizers.  Black South
                    Africans, from <br>tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid
                    law until the mid-1990s.  <br>A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white
                    South Africans: mixed-race or <br> “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race
                    South Africans were the most <br>marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by
                    what he wasn’t: not light enough to <br>be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted
                    into Black culture.
                    Apartheid ended in 1994, <br>but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It
                    was often hard for Noah to determine <br>which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged
                    her son to read and think independently; <br> she valued education and made sure that her son spoke
                    multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages <br> in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga,
                    English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among <br>different racial and cultural groups at
                    school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability <br>to talk and empathize
                    with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young <br>age, Noah
                    understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the <br>
                    self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but
                    Patricia believed <br> in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him
                    accountable because she loved him. <br> Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and
                    generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
