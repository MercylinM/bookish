                            even while being surrounded by others. He felt the need to be anonymous <br>
                            and invisible rather than seeking acceptance for his whole self.<br>
                            Trevor Noah frequently describes feeling invisible at school, <br>
                            particularly ,at Sandringham,a high-school with students of all<br>
                            races and backgrounds.Trevor found it difficult to find a "niche". <br>
                            He felt like he wasn't quite part of the black community or the white <br>
                            community, leading to a sense of isolation and invisibility.</p>

                        <p>kids would shit on Trevor all the time for being too black .even </p>
                        <p>if he was skilled with the white kids not to get bullied by them ,</p>
                        <p>they were always going shooping and movies and he didnt have money </p>

                        <p> he learned that even though he didnot belong to one group he </p>
                        could be a part of any group, but this constant performance also  
                            contributed to his feeling of being unseen.</p>

                    <h1>Personal Exprience</h1>
                    <p>The same with Trevor history,i was the kind of person who said "i can do everything by myself
                        ".when i went to highschool i was
                        like an outsider who
                        observe others when they play,eat,going home and study together .At that time i was a new comer
                        to that school and also to the society,it was hard to adapt their accent and their
                        lifestyle.
                        This made me quit,invisible and shy.people in my school were also grouped based on

                        where they lived and their wealth level but i was neither of these groups even if i
                        want to
                        conform the atmosphere.As a student i was broke when student went to shopping,cinema and trip i
                        did
                        my
                        assignments or study my lessons.For me ,i was a clever student and they would ask me to do
                        their home work or assignments
                        or assignment and that was the only chance to communicate with them ,if i wanted to ask a favour
                        or
                        anything from them
                        i use to do their tasks.</p>

                        <p> Generally an outsider person is that who has the feeling that<br> he or she
                            “is different from other people” and thinks <br>
                            that something is “wrong with he/she” but this is not the case at all .<br>
                            facing rejection from others and being bullied or excluded can be<br>
                            incredibly painful to experience. Feeling like an outsider takes <br>
                            a toll on mental health, leading to significant issues like low <br>
                            self-esteem, hopelessness, loneliness, or depression.In contrary<br>
                            their unique perspectives and fresh perspectives, often free from<br>
                            established group norms, can lead to innovative solutions and <br>

                <p id="lead-para">
                    Patricia Noah’s emphasis on independent thought<br>
                    transcended mere parenting;it was a crucial survival<br>
                    skill under apartheid. She armed Trevour with the <br>
                    ability to question everything, enabling him to navigtate<br>
                    segregation’s absurdities,challenge racial barriers, and<br>
                    build resilience againist oppression. In a society built on<br>
                    enforced ignorance,  critical thinking became a tool for<br>
                    recognizing injustice,even those that were not <br>
                    noticeable or were just taken for reality.<br>

                    </p>
                    <p id="sub-para">
                    This foundation proved invaluable. Instead of accepting the world as it was presented,<br>
                    Trevour learned to analyze, discern, and form his own conclusions. This ability to think <br>
                    critically wasn’t  just about intellectual curiosity; it was about empowerment and <br>
                    self-determination. She showed that everyone should look  outside the box and think <br>
                    with different eyes in order to be a fully functioning person.<br><br>

                    
                    This early training profoundly shaped Trevour’s career. His observational comedy,<br>
                    empathy and nuanced perspective as host of “The Daily Show “ stem directly from his<br>
                    ability to analyze complex issues and challenge conventional wisdom. He showed that<br>
                    his voice has a big effect on people of all types.<br><br>

                        <p>During apartheid, simply being Trevor's mother – a Black woman with a mixed-race child – put
                            both
                            of them in constant danger. </p>
                        <p>Patricia navigated this by:</p>

                        <p><em>Constantly strategizing and making difficult choices: </em>She moved to different neighborhoods, sometimes illegally, and even pretended Trevor
                            belonged
                            to someone else to keep him safe from authorities.</p>
                    
                        <p><em>Teaching him survival skills: </em>She taught him multiple languages so he could blend into different communities and avoid
                            detection. She also instilled in him a sense of independence and the ability to think on his
                            feet.</p>

                        <p><em>Providing unwavering love and support: </em>Despite the harsh realities they faced, Patricia's fierce passion and determination created
                            a
                            sense of security for Trevor in a world that was inherently hostile to his existence. Her
                            discipline, though sometimes strict, came from wanting to equip him for a difficult life.</p>
            
                            <br>
                        <p>This reflects the idea of family as a shield because Patricia actively worked to buffer
                            Trevor
                            from the dangers and injustices of the apartheid regime. She used her ingenuity, resilience,
                            and
                            love to create a layer of protection around him, much like a shield deflects attacks.</p>

                        language he was still learning.Instead of dwelling <br>on the danger and humiliation of the
                        incident ,Trevor recounts it with humor <br> ,highlighting the absurdity of the situation and
                        his own naivety.This shows <br>how Trevor uses humor to process and rise above difficult
                        moments.</p>

                        does not serve the Bantu to learn <br> history and science because he is primitive and it will

                    <p>Systems and structures often perpetuate systemic inequality to execute <br> power and many times
                        it is backed up by individual biases.For instance,<br>the government during apartheid built
                        Bantu schools which were meant <br> to teach metrics and agriculture. Systemic inequality
                        prevents a group of <br>people from exercising their freedom thereby constricting them to rules
                        <br> and laws that are inhuman in nature.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="review-category">
                <p>Dutch colonizers came to South Africa in the 1600s and used slave labor to run their farms on stolen
                    land. The white South Africans called Afrikaners are descended from these colonizers. Black South
                    Africans, from tribes including the Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho tribes, were subjugated under apartheid
                    law until the mid-1990s. A third racial group emerged from the intermingling of the Black and white
                    South Africans: mixed-race or “colored.” Both during apartheid and after its dissolution, mixed-race
                    South Africans were the most marginalized and disenfranchised people. Noah often felt defined by
                    what he wasn’t: not light enough to be labeled as white and not dark enough to be fully accepted
                    into Black culture.
                    Apartheid ended in 1994, but Noah’s struggles as a mixed-race child in South Africa continued. It
                    was often hard for Noah to determine which groups would accept him. Patricia had always encouraged
                    her son to read and think independently; she valued education and made sure that her son spoke
                    multiple languages. Of the eleven official languages in South Africa, Noah could speak Zulu, Tsonga,
                    English, and Afrikaans. This skill allowed him to move among different racial and cultural groups at
                    school. Though Noah felt out of place in many social settings, his ability to talk and empathize
                    with many different types of people served him well throughout his life. Even at a young age, Noah
                    understood that the bullying he experienced from his mixed-race peers was likely a result of the
                    self-hatred all mixed-race South Africans had been taught. Noah was a mischievous child, but
                    Patricia believed in tempering her punishments with assurances to her son that she held him
                    accountable because she loved him. Patricia knew that the world would not always be kind and
                    generous to Noah, and she wanted to prepare him well.
