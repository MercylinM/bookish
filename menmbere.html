                        “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”

                    <p>
                        The quote from Trevor Noah's "Born a Crime" highlights a complex issue about love and control in relationships. Abel wants a traditional marriage, but he also desires a woman who is free. This contradiction shows how some men may want a partner who is independent yet still want to keep them in a limited role.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In my society, traditional gender roles often expect women to be obedient and focused on family.
                        Many girls grow up believing that their main goal should be to marry and take care of the home. This can create a feeling of being trapped, much like the "cage" Abel imagines. For example, there are still many families that discourage girls from pursuing education or careers, pushing them instead towards marriage at a young age.
                    </p>  

                    <p>
                        However, I see a change happening. More women  inmy society are standing up for their rights and seeking education and careers. They want partners who support their dreams instead of trying to control them.  This shift is important because it shows that women can be both independent and loving partners.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Personally,I want a relationship built on respect and equality. I believe that love should not mean giving up my freedom or dreams. Instead, it should be about supporting each other’s goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, Abel's desire for a traditional wife who is also free reflects the struggle many face today.We need to challenge these old ideas about gender roles and create relationships where both partners can thrive without feeling trapped. True love should empower us, not cage us.
